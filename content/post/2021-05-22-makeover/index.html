<p>The DataViz Makeover-1 report aims to optimize the original graph by using the data from <a href="https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/trade-and-investment/merchandise-trade/latest-data">Department of Statistics in Singapore</a>.</p>

<div id="the-advantages-of-sketch" class="section level2">
<h2>4.1 The advantages of sketch</h2>
<ul>
<li>Split the export value and import value up for separate comparison.</li>
<li>Include quarter marks in x-axis to have a long x-axis so that people can see the detailed changes of value over time.</li>
<li>Include the average value for comparison.</li>

<div id="data-preprocessing-in-excel" class="section level2">
<h2>5.1 Data preprocessing in excel</h2>
<p>There are several rows on top of table which is unnecessary in data, so I removed them from excel.
<img src="unneccessary%20title%20in%20data.png" />
Since we need to compare the trading value based on countries instead of region. The first 6 rows show total value based on continents, so I removed them also.
<img src="remove%20continent.png" /></p>
</div>
<div id="data-preprocessing-in-tableau" class="section level2">
<h2>5.2 Data preprocessing in Tableau</h2>
<ul>
<li>Import two tables of data one by one into Tableau, remove the columns not in 2019-2021.
<img src="remove%20precious%20years%20data.png" /></li>
<li>Select all remaining years in the data, right click and select ‘Pivot’.
<img src="pivot%20data.png" /></li>
<li>Rename the field name

</ul>

<div id="visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>5.3 Visualization</h2>
<p>Once two tables are done with the 2 steps above, import them into tableau.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data blending</li>
</ul>
<p>Blend 2 data by linking Data relationship and country relationship between two tables.
<img src="data%20blending.png" />
<img src="data%20blending%20setup.png" />
A sign will appear next to the linked column in primary data.
<img src="relationship%20link%20label.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Drag ‘Date’ into column and sum (import value) , then drag the sum (export value) into the same position.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="column%20and%20rows.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Apply filter</li>
</ul>
<p>Drag either one of country in two table into the filter position (since two country columns are linked). Select particular 6 country in the list.
<img src="filter%20and%20add.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Apply color</li>
</ul>
<p>Drag country into ‘color’ in the pane, since there are lots of countries in the column, so we need to filter first then add. Check the particular 6 countries, then select ok.
The initial colors in the filter are shown like the picture below.
<img src="initial%20filter%20color.png" />
I add a reference line in each graph to determine the hue of line:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The countries whose export number is more than 100M will be set as red hue.</li>
<li>The countries whose export number is less than 10M will set as blue hue.
Then the colors are set like the picture below.
<img src="optimal%20color.png" /></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Rename titles and axis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Title was changed as ‘Merchandise Trade of Six Countries, 2019-2021),
Y-axis title was changed as ‘Import Value (1000 $)’ and ‘Export Value (1000$),
X-axis title was removed.</p>
</div>
<div id="create-proportion-table" class="section level2">
<h2>5.4 Create proportion table</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a new sheet in the Tableau workbook.</li>
<li>Drag countries into rows and drag import value into rows, change calculation as sum().</li>
<li>Change the way of showcase to ‘highlight table’.
<img src="show%20way.png" /></li>
<li>Change the value shown as percentage</li>
</ul>
<p>Right click on the sum (import value) &gt; quick table calculation &gt; percent of total.
<img src="percent%20of%20total.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Rename header and repeat the same step to create import value table.</li>
</ul>

<div id="dashboard-visualization" class="section level2">
<h2>5.5 Dashboard visualization</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add sheets</li>
</ul>
<p>Drag line graph into the left and drag two tables int the right.</p>
<ul>
<li>Add source</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Object &gt; Text &gt; drag text to the bottom, then add the source and the raw data link.</p>
<p>The final dashboard would be shown like the picture below.

<h1>6. Insights from new graph</h1>
<ul>
<li>Japan and Taiwan have the similar flat trend in terms of Export value changes over time.</li>
<li>Mainland China has the most value in both export and import most of time.</li>
<li>Hong Kong has a very large number of export value during 2 years whereas, in comparison to import value, it has the least import value.</li>
<li>For United States, we can see a downward trend both in import and export.</li>
